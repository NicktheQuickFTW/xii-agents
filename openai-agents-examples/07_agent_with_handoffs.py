Agent with Handoffs Example

This example demonstrates how to create agents that can hand off tasks to other specialized agents.
It shows how to implement a customer support system with a triage agent and specialist agents.

Run with:
    uv run 07_agent_with_handoffs.py --prompt "I need help with my billing"

Test with:
    uv run pytest 07_agent_with_handoffs.py
