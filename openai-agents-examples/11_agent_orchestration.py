Agent Orchestration Example

This example demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple agents to work together on complex tasks.
It shows how to create a system where specialized agents collaborate under the coordination
of a manager agent.

Run with:
    uv run 11_agent_orchestration.py --prompt "Create a blog post about climate change solutions"

Test with:
    uv run pytest 11_agent_orchestration.py
