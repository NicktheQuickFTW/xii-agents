Synchronous Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to run an agent synchronously instead of asynchronously.
It shows how to use the Runner.run_sync function for simpler code in non-async environments.

Run with:
    uv run 03_sync_agent.py --prompt "What are the benefits of exercise?"

Test with:
    uv run pytest 03_sync_agent.py
