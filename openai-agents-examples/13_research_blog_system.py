Research and Blog Agent System

This example demonstrates a complete system where research agents and blog agents work together
to create markdown blogs. It showcases the integration of multiple agent capabilities.

Run with:
    uv run 13_research_blog_system.py --topic "Artificial Intelligence Ethics" --output blog_post.md

Test with:

            Key principles include:
            1. Transparency - AI systems should be explainable and understandable
            2. Fairness - AI should not perpetuate or amplify biases
            3. Privacy - AI systems should respect user privacy and data rights
            4. Accountability - Clear responsibility for AI decisions and impacts
            5. Safety - AI systems should be reliable and minimize harm
            
            Current challenges include:
            - Algorithmic bias in facial recognition and criminal justice systems
            - Privacy concerns with data collection and surveillance
            - Autonomous weapons and military applications
